Evaluating Program Impact
Simulating the Evaluation of mHealth Intervention for Diabetes Management in Africa
This repository contains code that simulates a real-world scenario of evaluating the impact of a mobile health intervention on diabetes management across multiple African countries. The code is written in R and follows a structured approach to conduct the evaluation.

Key Steps:
#Literature Review and Identifying Barriers: Conducts a literature review using the pubmed.mineR package to identify barriers to diabetes management in Africa.

#Identifying Evidence-Based Interventions: Selects evidence-based interventions such as mobile apps for glucose monitoring, educational campaigns, and personalized coaching.

#Designing Evaluation Methods: Defines assessment tools and outcomes, including blood glucose levels, medication adherence, and quality of life.

#Simulating Data: Simulates demographic and diabetes-related variables to represent the target population.

#Cleaning and Analyzing Data: Cleans and analyzes the simulated data to assess the impact of the intervention on diabetes outcomes.

#Generating Reports: Generates a comprehensive report summarizing the identified barriers, selected interventions, assessment tools, and data analysis results.

#Libraries Used:
tidyverse: Required for data cleaning and manipulation.
pubmed.mineR: Allows extraction of biomedical literature.
How to Use:
Clone the repository.
Open the R script.
Modify the path to your data file if needed.
Run the script to simulate the evaluation process and generate the report.
